      text: `2. Based on historical records, we can say that many ancient societies devised symbols to represent 
numbers and solutions to mathematical problems. Although thinkers began to take the first steps 
towards mathematics early on, it can be asserted that only with Greek civilisation did this discipline 
acquire the abstract and general characteristics that render it distinct and render it a unique science. 
It is noteworthy that mathematics evolved into an abstract and general science at a deliberate pace. 
Documents from pre-Greek civilisations indicate that solutions to mathematical problems were 
confined to specific, tangible cases. These documents convey the impression that mathematical 
concepts were communicated sporadically and non-methodically (occasionally even fortuitously), 
and were treated as useful information geared towards practical outcomes.

Which of the following CANNOT be inferred from the text?`,
      options: [
        "Since antiquity, mathematics has been characterized by abstractness and generality.",
        "In antiquity, mathematical notions were not communicated in a methodical manner.",
